REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints and principles for designing networked applications. REST APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are interfaces that adhere to these REST principles and allow communication and interaction between different systems over the internet.

Here are some key characteristics and concepts of REST APIs:

01. Resources: REST APIs are centered around resources, which can be any information or entity that can be identified and manipulated. Resources are typically represented by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) or URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

02. Stateless: REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from a client to the server must contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request. The server does not retain any session or context information about the client between requests.

03. CRUD Operations: REST APIs provide a set of standard operations for working with resources, known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These operations map to the HTTP methods as follows:

   - Create: POST - Used to create a new resource.
   - Read: GET - Used to retrieve a representation of a resource or a collection of resources.
   - Update: PUT/PATCH - Used to update an existing resource.
   - Delete: DELETE - Used to delete a resource.

04. Uniform Interface: REST APIs follow a uniform interface that defines a consistent way to interact with resources. The interface typically includes the use of standard HTTP methods, status codes, and hypermedia links for navigating between resources.

05. HTTP as the Communication Protocol: REST APIs utilize the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as the underlying communication protocol. This leverages the existing infrastructure and features provided by HTTP, such as caching, security, and authentication.

06. Response Formats: REST APIs can support various response formats, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language). JSON has become the most common format due to its simplicity and widespread support in web development.

07. HATEOAS: HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a principle in REST that suggests including hypermedia links in API responses. These links provide clients with information about available actions or related resources, allowing for dynamic discovery and navigation through the API.

REST APIs have become the de facto standard for building web services due to their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the web. They are widely used in a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and more, enabling interoperability and integration between different systems.
