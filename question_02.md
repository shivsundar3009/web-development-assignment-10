Express is actually a web framework for Node.js, so it is not a matter of choosing Express over Node.js. Rather, it's about choosing Express as a framework to build web applications using Node.js.

Here are some reasons why developers often choose to use Express.js over building directly with Node.js:

01. Simplicity: Express.js provides a simple and minimalistic framework for building web applications. It offers a straightforward API and a set of intuitive features, making it easier to get started with Node.js web development.

02. Middleware: Express.js has a robust middleware system that allows developers to easily add functionality to their applications. Middleware can be used for tasks such as handling requests, parsing data, performing authentication, logging, error handling, and more. The middleware layer simplifies the handling of common tasks and promotes code reusability.

03. Routing: Express.js provides a flexible and intuitive routing system. It allows developers to define routes and handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for different URLs. The routing mechanism helps organize and structure the application's endpoints and makes it easier to manage complex routing scenarios.

04. Large ecosystem: Express.js has a vast ecosystem with a wide range of third-party libraries and modules available. These modules can extend the functionality of Express or provide additional features for specific use cases. The extensive ecosystem offers solutions for various needs, such as database integration, template engines, authentication, validation, and more.

05. Flexibility: Express.js provides a high degree of flexibility, allowing developers to customize and configure their applications according to their specific requirements. It does not impose strict conventions or architectures, giving developers the freedom to choose and integrate other libraries or tools as needed.

06. Community and documentation: Express.js has a vibrant and active community of developers. It is widely used and well-documented, with numerous tutorials, guides, and resources available. The active community ensures ongoing support, frequent updates, and a wealth of knowledge-sharing.

It's important to note that Express.js is not the only framework available for building web applications with Node.js. Other frameworks like Koa, Hapi, and Nest.js offer alternative approaches and features. The choice of framework depends on factors such as project requirements, personal preference, ecosystem support, and community activity.
